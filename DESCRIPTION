Description: The Sector-Adjusted Point Projection (SAPP) package provides tools
for visualizing the influence of features in a dataset. It allows users to
project data points into a circular plot where each sector corresponds to a
feature's importance, and the points are adjusted based on the most influential 
feature. The package can be used for model interpretability, feature analysis, 
and visualization in machine learning and data science contexts.
